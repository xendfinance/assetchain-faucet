## How to Tell Us About Security Problems

Keeping PoWFaucet safe is very important. If you find a security problem, I'd really appreciate your help in telling me about it in a safe way.

### For Regular Bugs

If you find a bug that's not about security, please just tell me on GitHub Issues. That way, everyone can see it and help fix it.

### For Serious Security Bugs

If you find a big security issue that shouldn't be shared with everyone for safety reasons, please tell me directly:

- **Matrix**: `@pk910:matrix.org`
- **Twitter**: `@_pk910_`

Please don't tell everyone about these big issues until I've had a chance to look at them. I promise to check out what you tell me quickly and work with you to fix any problems safely.

## Helping Out

I'm the main person looking after PoWFaucet, but I'm always happy to get help from others, especially if it's about making PoWFaucet safer or more protective.

Thanks for helping keep PoWFaucet safe and secure!
