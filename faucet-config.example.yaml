    <h5>What is a PoW Faucet?</h5>
    This is a Ethereum Faucet running on the Goerli Testnet.<br>
    To prevent malicious actors from exhausting all available funds or 
    accumulating enough Ether to mount long running spam attacks, 
    this faucet requires some mining work to be done in exchange for 
    free testnet funds.
  </div>
  <div class='pow-info'>
    <h5>How does this work?</h5>
    Just enter your ETH Address and start mining. 
    When you've collected enough ETH, stop mining and claim your rewards.
  </div>
  <div class='pow-info'>
    <h5>How to help the faucet?</h5>
    Replenish the faucet by sending funds you don't need anymore to:<br>

# how long sessions can be payed out (in seconds)
# should be higher than powSessionTimeout

  cpuAndMemory: 4096
  # r - block size: affects memory and CPU usage
  blockSize: 8
  # p - parallelism factor: threads to run in parallel, affects the memory & CPU usage, should be 1 as webworker is single threaded

# Proof of Work shares need to be verified to prevent malicious users from just sending in random numbers.
# As that can lead to a huge verification work load on the server, this faucet can redistribute shares back to other miners for verification.
# These randomly selected miners need to check the share and return its validity to the server within 10 seconds or they're penalized.
# If theres a missmatch in validity-result the share is checked again locally and miners returning a bad verification result are slashed.
# Bad shares always result in a slashing (termination of session and loss of all collected mining balance)
